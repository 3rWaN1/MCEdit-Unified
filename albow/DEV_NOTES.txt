Read carefully before downloading. This is a test release.

In order to test this, just download the zip and decompress it somewhere it
won't affect your development code (if you're a MCEdit dev).

Please, report any error/issue/remark here:
https://github.com/Khroki/MCEdit-Unified/issues/71
Be sure to make your comment unique and easely findable (this will improve time
reaction and issue correction/tracking).
If possible, please join error tracebacks, screenshots, and mcedit.log.

Sumary of changes (see also CHANGES.txt):

* json format dropped down for translation resource files. Back to plain UTF-8
  text.
  This is intended to be more user friendly for non programer users.
  Doing this, other translation than french one aren't available (but this is
  only temporary).

* back to the '_()' function (instead of 'tr()'). This is faster to write one
  character instead of two, and, it is visualy more perceptible in the code.

* some useless function/methods have been dropped down. Especially those which
  were using uninitialized code.
  Parts of this code was, IMO, not relevant in the GUI. It is preferable to
  implement it elsewhere, since it depends on the 'core' of MCEdit.
  I mean that a simple code is more efficient at runtime and simplier to
  maintain.


Coming later:

* functionalities to create a language template. It will contain the original
  (english) strings to be translated.
  This will need a certain amount of work and programing rigor.

* functionalities to avoid MCEdit restart after a language change. The GUI will
  be changed 'on the fly'. (Alos needs work and rigor.)

Of course, the choices I've made aren't God's law, and can (will?) be discussed.

Enjoy !
