Inital commit on the branch 'localisation-code'.

* json format dropped down for translation resource files. Back to plain UTF-8
  text.
  This is intended to be more user friendly for non programer users.
  Doing this, other translation than french one aren't available (but this is
  only temporary).

* back to the '_()' function (instead of 'tr()'). This is faster to write one
  character instead of two, and, it is visualy more perceptible in the code.

* some useless function/methods have been dropped down. Especially those which
  were using uninitialized code.
  Parts of this code was, IMO, not relevant in the GUI. It is preferable to
  implement it elsewhere, since it depends on the 'core' of MCEdit.
  I mean that a simple code is more efficient at runtime and simplier to
  maintain.
